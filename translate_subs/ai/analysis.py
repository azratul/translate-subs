"""Episode context analysis (Phase 2).

Before translating, the model reads the whole episode (as a clean
`[ID] Speaker: text` transcript) and produces a context sheet: summary,
characters (gender/role/speech style/relationships), glossary and translation
rules. The sheet is saved and later folded into the translation prompts so the
result respects gender, formality (tú/usted/ustedes) and term consistency.

The core invariant holds: the raw subtitle file is never sent — only the
extracted visible text with stable IDs.

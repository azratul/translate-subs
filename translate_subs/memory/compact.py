"""Compact per-series memory: drop dead glossary entries and redundant characters.

Memory only ever grows as episodes are analyzed. This prunes entries that carry no
instruction so prompts and files stay small: glossary mappings where source == target,
case-insensitive duplicate terms/characters, and characters with no usable information.

With a runner, a second LLM pass detects character aliases (e.g. "Alice" and
"Alice Chambers") that slipped past exact-name matching during merge.

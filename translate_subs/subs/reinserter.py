"""Reinsert translations into the SSAFile and prepare it for export.

The visible text is replaced via `event.plaintext`, which drops inline ASS override
tags; the whole-line leading block (e.g. `{\\an8\\pos(..)}`) captured at extraction is
then restored ahead of it. Style-level attributes (the style name, hence its
alignment/colour/font) are kept too, so an .ass export still places e.g. a top-aligned
translator note above the dialogue. An .srt export has no positioning, so the restored
tags are stripped by the writer and `flatten_overlaps` merges simultaneous cues instead.

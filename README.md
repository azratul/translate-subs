# translate-subs

Contextual subtitle translator **from any language to any language** using an LLM through its
CLI (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`) or a model API (`ollama`, `litellm`). Unlike
line-by-line machine translation, it leverages **context**: character gender,
formality/register, relationships, per-series glossary, and tone.

- **Input:** any format `pysubs2` reads (`.ass`/`.srt`/`.sub`/…) or a video container (`.mkv`/…)
  whose embedded subtitle track is demuxed.
- **Output:** `<base>.<lang>.<format>` (`<lang>` derived from `--target`). The default format is
  **`.ass`**; with `--format srt` it exports `.srt`. See [Output format](#output-format-ass-vs-srt).
- **Design invariant:** the raw file is never sent to the LLM. It is parsed, only the *visible
  text* is extracted with stable IDs (`0001`, `0002`, …), and the model only sees
  `[ID] Speaker: text`, returning the same IDs. On reinsertion the **whole-line leading override
  block** (`{\an8\pos(..)\c..}`) is restored, so in `.ass` position/color/scale/fade match the
  original; the event's **style** (alignment, color, font) is kept too. Inside-text tags and
  karaoke are dropped. `.srt` has no positioning, so only basic italic/bold survives.

## Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.11 and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
- `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` (for embedded tracks inside containers).
- At least one backend to actually translate: an agent CLI (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`,
  `opencode`) installed and authenticated, a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) server
  (`--provider ollama --model qwen3:4b`, host from `$OLLAMA_HOST`), or [LiteLLM]
  (https://docs.litellm.ai) (`uv sync --extra litellm`, then `--provider litellm --model
  ollama/qwen3:4b`). (The `identity` provider does not translate: it copies the text and is used
  to verify the round-trip.)

## Installation

### As a global command (recommended for use)

Install it once and run `translate-subs` from any directory (it does not need a checkout):

```bash
# From a clone:
uv tool install .          # or: pipx install .

# Directly from GitHub (no clone):
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/azratul/translate-subs"
# or: pipx install "git+https://github.com/azratul/translate-subs"

translate-subs --help
```

`ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` are **system** dependencies (not installed by pip); install them with your
package manager. For `--provider litellm`, add the extra: `uv tool install ".[litellm]"`.

Per-series memory and other state are stored under the standard user data directory
(`$XDG_DATA_HOME/translate-subs`, i.e. `~/.local/share/translate-subs` on Linux), and extracted
tracks under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/translate-subs`. Override the whole data root with
`$TRANSLATE_SUBS_HOME` (e.g. to keep a project's memory next to a checkout:
`export TRANSLATE_SUBS_HOME=/path/to/repo/data`). Translated subtitles are written **next to the
input file** by default (`--out-dir`/`--output` to change that), not under the data dir.

### From a tagged release

Each GitHub release attaches a built wheel and sdist. To install a specific version without a
clone (replace `vX.Y.Z` with the release tag):

```bash
# Pin a release tag straight from the repository:
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/azratul/translate-subs@vX.Y.Z"
# or from the attached wheel:
pipx install "https://github.com/azratul/translate-subs/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/translate_subs-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl"
```

### For development (from a checkout)

```bash
uv sync                       # install deps into the project venv
uv run translate-subs --help  # run via uv without a global install
```

If the entry point fails with `No module named 'translate_subs'`, the editable install is stale:
`uv sync --reinstall-package translate-subs`.

### Build distributable artifacts

```bash
uv build   # writes a wheel and sdist to dist/
```

## Privacy and cost

The tool sends the **visible text** of your subtitles to the backend you pick with
`--provider`. What that means for privacy and cost:

- **Remote backends** — the agent CLIs (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`) and `litellm`
  pointed at a hosted model — transmit that text to a third party, subject to that provider's
  retention and pricing. Cost is typically per token, or covered by your CLI subscription.
- **Local backends** — `ollama` (and `litellm` pointed at a local model) — keep everything on
  your machine at no per-use cost.

For sensitive material, or to avoid per-token billing, use a local backend. See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model, including prompt-injection notes when routing
untrusted subtitles through an agent CLI that has tool access.

## Quick start

The series has Japanese audio and an **embedded English** subtitle track in `.ass`. Let's
translate **episode 1 to Latin American Spanish** with `codex` / `gpt-5.5`.

```bash
# (Optional) List the embedded subtitle tracks
uv run translate-subs probe /your/media/TV_Shows/Show/Season/file.mkv
```

### Quick option: translate without memory

```bash
uv run translate-subs translate /your/media/TV_Shows/Show/Season/file.mkv \
  --provider codex --model gpt-5.5 \
  --lang en --target es-latam \
  --reasoning medium \
  --non-interactive
```

This option produces the `.ass`, but creates no context or shared memory across episodes.

### Recommended option: analyze and translate with memory

Use exactly the same `--project` in both commands:

```bash
# 1) Analyze the episode and create/update the series memory
uv run translate-subs analyze /your/media/TV_Shows/Show/Season/file.mkv \
  --provider codex --model gpt-5.5 \
  --lang en --target es-latam \
  --reasoning medium \
  --project "Your TV Show Name" \
  --non-interactive

# 2) Translate using the episode context and accumulated memory
uv run translate-subs translate /your/media/TV_Shows/Show/Season/file.mkv \
  --provider codex --model gpt-5.5 \
  --lang en --target es-latam \
  --reasoning medium \
  --project "Your TV Show Name" \
  --non-interactive
```

For the following episodes, repeat `analyze → translate` keeping
`--project "Your TV Show Name"`. Each analysis updates the memory and each translation uses
what has been learned so far.

`analyze` stores a fingerprint of the analyzed subtitle in `episode.context.json`. If you later
`translate` or `review` against a changed version of that subtitle, the tool **warns** that the
context sheet may be stale (re-run `analyze` to refresh it) — it never blocks, and older context
files without the fingerprint are left alone.

Result, next to the `.mkv` (so the player loads it automatically):

```
/your/media/TV_Shows/Show/Season/Example - S01E01.es.ass
```

(With `--format srt` the file would be `….es.srt`.)

### Review and readability (optional)

```bash
# Review and apply only safe fixes (confirmed gender, glossary, names…)
uv run translate-subs review "$EP" "$OUT" --provider codex --model gpt-5.5 \
  --project "Your project" --apply --non-interactive

# Readability control: compact lines that exceed the on-screen limits
uv run translate-subs tighten "$OUT" --provider codex --model gpt-5.5 \
  --project "Your project" --apply

# Validate the final file
uv run translate-subs validate "$OUT"
```

`analyze`, `translate`, `review`, and `tighten` let you pick the CLI with `--provider`/`--model`;
`--reasoning` applies to Codex. Transient backend/protocol failures retry twice by default with
backoff, jitter and `Retry-After` support; permanent authentication/configuration failures stop
immediately (`--retries 0` disables retries).

## Any language → any language

`--lang` is the **source** language (label and track selection); `--target` is the **destination**
(it drives the rules, the prompt, and the file name).

```bash
# Japanese -> English   => ep.en.ass
uv run translate-subs translate ep.mkv --provider codex --model gpt-5.5 --lang ja --target en

# English -> French     => ep.fr.ass
uv run translate-subs translate ep.en.srt --provider codex --model gpt-5.5 --lang en --target fr-FR
```

## Output format (`.ass` vs `.srt`)

`--format` controls the output container (and the file extension):

- **`ass` (default):** keeps **style-level** positioning. This matters when the original subtitle
  shows **two simultaneous texts in different positions** — e.g. a translator note on top and the
  dialogue at the bottom, both with the same timestamp. In `.ass` each one keeps its style
  (alignment/color/font) and they display without colliding.
- **`srt`:** flat, universal format, with no positioning. To avoid losing those cases,
  **overlapping events are merged**: the timeline is split at every cue boundary and each interval
  becomes a single subtitle that **stacks** the active texts (the top-aligned text comes first).
  This way two simultaneous cues end up in a single two-line subtitle instead of colliding (most
  players, faced with two cues at the same time, show only one).

When the translated text is reinserted, the **whole-line leading override block** (e.g.
`{\an8\pos(..)\c&H..&}` at the very start of an event) is preserved, so on an `.ass` export the
line keeps its original position, colour, scale and fade. Tags that sit *inside* the text are
tied to the original wording and are dropped, as is karaoke (`\k`, per-syllable). `.ass` also
preserves the event's style (alignment/colour/font). On a flat `.srt` the writer strips
positioning anyway, so only basic italic/bold survive.

```bash
# .srt output (instead of the default .ass)
uv run translate-subs translate "$EP" --provider codex --model gpt-5.5 \
  --lang en --target es-latam --format srt --non-interactive
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `probe <media>` | Lists the embedded subtitle tracks of a container. |
| `translate <input>` | Translates and exports `<base>.<lang>.<format>` (`.ass` by default, `.srt` with `--format srt`). |
| `batch <directory>` | Translates every matching file in a directory (`--glob`, default `*.mkv`; `-r` recurses), skipping done episodes and continuing past per-episode failures. |
| `config <project>` | Shows or sets per-project default options (provider, model, target, lang, format, reasoning) in `settings.json`. |
| `analyze <input>` | Generates `episode.context.json` and updates the series memory. |
| `review <source> <translated>` | Quality review → `episode.review.md` (with `--apply`, applies the safe fixes). |
| `tighten <translated>` | Flags and compacts subtitles that break the readability limits. |
| `update-memory <input>` | Re-merges an existing `episode.context.json` into the memory (no LLM call). |
| `compact-memory <project>` | Prunes redundant memory (identity glossary terms, duplicate/info-less characters). |
| `resolve-conflicts <project>` | Walks flagged `conflicts.json` entries interactively (keep stored / use suggested / skip). |
| `validate <subtitle>` | Structural validation (parseable, timings, no leftover markup). |
| `doctor [--provider <name>]` | Checks the environment: media tools (ffprobe/ffmpeg), writable data/cache dirs, and — with `--provider` — that provider's backend (CLI on PATH, reachable Ollama server, or installed litellm). |

### Providers (`--provider`)

`identity` (passthrough, no translation) · `file-handoff` (writes the job protocol to fill in by
hand) · `claude` · `codex` · `gemini` · `opencode` · `ollama` (local server) · `litellm` (router
SDK).

- `ollama` POSTs to `$OLLAMA_HOST` (default `http://localhost:11434`) `/api/chat` with
  `format=json` and thinking **off** (translation isn't reasoning-heavy, and a thinking model
  like qwen3 is far slower with it on; non-thinking models ignore the flag). It suits
  cheap/local models for the high-volume `translate` step (keep a strong model on
  `analyze`/`review`). `litellm` routes to any backend via its SDK with the provider
  prefix in `--model` (e.g. `ollama/qwen3:4b`, `gpt-4o-mini`); install it with
  `uv sync --extra litellm`.
- `--model <id>` sets the provider's model (e.g. `--model gpt-5.5` for codex, `--model qwen3:4b`
  for ollama). For `ollama`/`litellm` it is required.
- `--reasoning <minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh>` tunes the reasoning effort of **codex**
  (default `low`: translating doesn't need `xhigh`, which is slower and costlier).
- `--retries <n>` controls retries on agent failures, invalid JSON, or wrong IDs (default `2`).

### Cross-cutting flags

`--non-interactive` / `--yes` / `-y` · `--lang` (source language) · `--target` (target language) ·
`--on-conflict {ask,keep,overwrite,flag}` · `--project` (series name). `translate` also takes
`--format {ass,srt}` (default `ass`), `--strict-lang` (refuse a different-language subtitle),
`--fail-on-untranslated` (exit non-zero if any line kept the source text — useful in batch
scripts; the file is still written so you can inspect it), and `--no-resume` (see below).

### Resume, caching and progress

Translating a full episode is dozens of slow LLM calls. Each block's result is checkpointed to
`<project>/<target>/<episode>/translations.checkpoint.json` as soon as it returns, keyed by a hash of
everything that steers that block — target, rules, its lines **and the before/after context lines
sent with it**. So:

- **Resume:** if a run crashes (or you Ctrl-C it) on block 38 of 40, rerunning picks up from the
  checkpoint and only translates what's left — the finished blocks are reused.
- **Cache:** if you re-translate after editing a few lines, only the affected blocks are redone;
  the rest are reused verbatim. Because the context is part of the key, editing a line also
  re-translates the neighbouring blocks that saw it as context, so a stale-context translation is
  never reused.
- The checkpoint is scoped to the `provider|model` signature, so switching backend (e.g. from a
  local Ollama model to `claude`) re-translates rather than inheriting the old output.
- The translation prompt has an explicit version included in each block hash, so prompt changes
  invalidate stale cached translations even when the subtitle text itself is unchanged.
- `--no-resume` ignores any saved checkpoint and re-translates every block from scratch.

On a terminal, `translate` shows a live progress bar (current block, count and ETA); in a pipe
or CI log it stays quiet. Only the CLI/API providers are checkpointed — `identity` is instant and
`file-handoff` writes all its jobs up front.

### Translating a whole season

`batch` runs `translate` over every matching file in a directory, sharing one `--project`:

```bash
translate-subs batch "TV Shows/Show/Season 1" --project "Show" --target es-latam --provider claude
translate-subs batch . --glob '*.mkv' --glob '*.mp4' -r          # several patterns, recurse
```

It selects files with `--glob` (default `*.mkv`, repeatable; `-r`/`--recursive` descends into
subdirectories) and skips any file that already looks like one of its own outputs. Each episode
is independent: one whose output already exists is **skipped** (pass `--force` to redo it), and one
that errors is **failed** and the run moves on — a single bad episode never aborts the season. A
summary table reports translated/skipped/failed, and the command exits non-zero if any episode
failed (or, with `--fail-on-untranslated`, if any line was left untranslated). Because each
episode still checkpoints per block, interrupting a season and rerunning resumes mid-episode.

### Per-project defaults

Instead of repeating `--provider`, `--model`, `--target`, etc. for every episode of a series, pin
them once with `config`:

```bash
translate-subs config "Show" --provider ollama --model qwen3:4b --target es-latam
translate-subs config "Show"                       # show current defaults
translate-subs config "Show" --unset model         # clear a field back to the built-in default
```

These are stored in `<project>/settings.json` (next to the memory files; hand-editable too) and
used by `translate` and `batch` as defaults: an explicit flag always wins, then the project
setting, then the tool's built-in default. The auxiliary commands (`analyze`, `review`,
`tighten`) still take their options explicitly.

### What `--project` actually does

`--project "Series Name"` identifies the memory shared across episodes. It is not an input
directory, it does not discover files, and it does not trigger analysis automatically.

- `analyze --project ...` creates or updates `data/projects/<series>/<target>/`, the
  episode's context card, the character memory, and the glossary.
- `translate --project ...` only loads that memory and context if they already exist.
- `review --project ...` uses the same information to review the translation.

Therefore, running only `translate --project "Series"` produces the output file, but does not
create `data/projects/` or accumulate memory. To get contextual translation across episodes you
must first run `analyze` for each episode:

```bash
uv run translate-subs analyze episode.mkv \
  --provider codex --project "Series" --non-interactive

uv run translate-subs translate episode.mkv \
  --provider codex --project "Series" --non-interactive
```

## Memory and conflicts

The memory created by `analyze` lives under `data/projects/<series>/<target>/` (segmented by the
full target — `es-latam` and `es-ES` are kept apart — so a glossary built for one never steers
another). When `--project` is omitted the series name is taken from the source's folder, skipping a
season/specials subfolder (`Season 1`, `S02`, `Specials`) in favour of the series folder above it:

- `memory.json` — characters (name, gender, style, relationships).
- `glossary.json` — fixed terms (organizations, places, techniques, titles…).
- `style_guide.json` — locale/variant, honorifics, tone, formality policy.
- `conflicts.json` — conflicts flagged for manual review.

`compact-memory`, `resolve-conflicts` and `update-memory` take `--target` to choose which
language's memory to act on (default `es-latam`). Per-episode state (context, checkpoint, reports)
lives in a subdirectory keyed by the source file's name **and** a short hash of its folder, so two
same-named episodes in different season folders never share context or checkpoints.

These persisted files use strict, versioned schemas. Legacy unversioned files are still read for
compatibility; malformed files fail at load time with the offending path instead of surfacing
later as an unrelated runtime error.

A new suggestion **never silently overwrites** a stored discrete decision (confirmed gender or
glossary rendering). `--on-conflict` decides: `flag` (non-interactive default: keep and record),
`keep`, `overwrite`, or `ask` (interactive default: prompt). Relationship descriptions are free
text rather than discrete decisions, so the most informative description is kept. Series
decisions take **precedence** over episode ones when translating.

### Token efficiency

Memory only grows as a series is analyzed, so dumping it whole into every prompt would make token
cost climb with every episode. To avoid that, `translate` injects the memory **per block,
filtered by relevance**: each block only carries the glossary terms and characters that its own
lines mention (identity mappings `term -> term` are dropped entirely). Cost stays bounded by
episode content instead of series history — on a real run this cut the rules payload by ~94%.

`compact-memory <project>` is the housekeeping companion: it removes identity/duplicate glossary
terms and duplicate or info-less characters from `data/projects/<series>/`. Run it whenever the
memory has accumulated noise:

```bash
uv run translate-subs compact-memory "Your Project"
```

Contradicting suggestions are recorded in `conflicts.json` rather than silently overwriting a
stored decision. Only **discrete** decisions are conflict-eligible — glossary renderings (compared
with whitespace/case/trailing punctuation folded, so trivial differences are ignored) and
confirmed gender; relationship descriptions are free text and never flagged. To clear the backlog,
`resolve-conflicts <project>` walks each flagged conflict and asks whether to keep the stored value,
use the suggested one, or skip it (leaving it in the log):

```bash
uv run translate-subs resolve-conflicts "Your Project"
```

You also don't need to `analyze` every episode: the cast and glossary stabilize after the first
several, and `translate` keeps using the accumulated memory regardless. Analyzing a subset and
translating the rest saves the per-episode analysis transcripts.

## Readability

Recommended limits (configurable in `tighten`): **42** characters per line, **2** lines,
**18** characters per second. Lines that exceed them receive an LLM compaction pass bounded by
the per-second character budget of each subtitle's duration. Compaction replies must map every
requested ID to a non-empty string; arrays, objects and other non-text values are rejected.

The review report also checks source/target structure before linguistic quality: missing or extra
events, duplicate internal IDs, timestamp/order mismatches and relevant ASS style differences are
reported explicitly. Automatic fixes remain disabled unless the files map safely by position and
timing.

## Development

```bash
uv run pytest -q                                                   # the whole suite
uv run pytest tests/test_round_trip.py::test_blocks_have_context   # a single test
```

This README is authoritative for current behaviour. Translation is decoupled behind a provider
abstraction: the deterministic core (parsing/reinsertion/validation) is never mixed with the
quirks of each CLI.

`translate_subs/pipeline.py` and `translate_subs/cli.py` are stable compatibility facades.
Application logic is grouped by use case under `translate_subs/workflows/`, while Typer callbacks
live under `translate_subs/commands/`. Existing imports, command names, options and output remain
on the facades so integrations do not depend on the internal module layout.

## Scope, non-goals and limitations

`translate-subs` is a focused, single-user command-line tool. The items below are **deliberate
decisions**, documented here so they are not repeatedly filed as defects. They are choices about
scope, not oversights.

### Positioning: a focused community CLI, not a production platform

This project is deliberately built as a **focused community CLI** that you install and run on your
own machine — not as a hosted product that third parties depend on in production. That choice is
what makes the items below *out of scope rather than missing*: each is only worth its ongoing
maintenance cost once other people's production systems depend on this tool, which is explicitly
**not** the goal.

Concretely, the recurring "to reach 100/100" asks — an automated linguistic-quality benchmark,
heavyweight supply-chain tooling (SBOM, signing, provenance, CodeQL, Dependabot), multi-process
locking, and full agent sandboxing — are excluded for the same underlying reason:

- **No third party depends on this in production.** Locking solves multi-writer races you don't
  have when one person runs one project at a time; supply-chain attestation and signing matter
  when others pull your artifacts into their builds, not for a `pipx install git+…`.
- **The high-value alternative is cheaper and already present.** Quality is guarded by the
  `review`/`tighten` passes, the deterministic contract and human reading, rather than a
  research-grade eval harness (a serious golden corpus with blind human evaluation is a project in
  itself). Untrusted-input risk is mitigated by *using a local inference backend* (`ollama`) and
  not granting agents tool access — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — rather than by building a
  sandbox around CLIs you installed yourself.
- **Maintenance has a real cost.** Each of these is continuous upkeep (corpus curation, release
  signing infra, lock contention handling) that would slow the parts that actually improve the
  tool for its users — see *Planned, not yet implemented* below for where effort goes instead.

Adopting these would mean re-scoping the project from "focused CLI" to "production platform"; that
is a different product with a much higher maintenance floor, and it is not the direction here. The
specific items follow.

### Out of scope by design

- **Heavyweight release / supply-chain tooling.** The repo ships a `CHANGELOG`, `CONTRIBUTING`,
  a `SECURITY` threat model, a CI that builds and smoke-tests the wheel, and GitHub Actions
  pinned by commit SHA. It does **not** add SBOM, provenance attestation, artifact signing,
  CodeQL, Dependabot/Renovate or fully automated SemVer release pipelines — that machinery is
  maintenance overhead with no benefit for a community CLI distributed via a tagged release and
  `pipx install git+…`.
- **An automated translation-quality benchmark / "golden" corpus.** This is repeatedly raised as
  the headline gap, so to be explicit: there is **no** golden-corpus, blind human-eval harness or
  per-provider/prompt linguistic-regression suite, and there won't be — a serious one is a
  research project of its own. Quality is guarded by the `review` and `tighten` passes, by the
  deterministic contract (stable IDs, ID/timestamp validation, glossary/gender consistency
  checks) and by human reading. Prompt changes are reviewed by their effect on real episodes, not
  by an automated score.
- **A hard coverage threshold in CI.** Coverage is measured and reported, not gated. A 90–95%
  gate tends to incentivise filler tests; effort goes to tests that exercise real behaviour (CLI,
  extraction) instead of chasing a number.
- **Fuzz / property-based testing of ASS/SRT.** Parsing is delegated to `pysubs2`; the project
  tests its own extraction/reinsertion logic, not the parser's robustness to malformed input.
- **OS-level sandboxing of agent CLIs.** Each agent CLI is invoked with its own built-in
  restriction so untrusted subtitle text can't talk it into touching your files: `codex` runs
  `--sandbox read-only`, `claude` denies every filesystem/exec/network/subagent tool and ignores
  all MCP servers (`--strict-mcp-config`), `gemini` uses `--approval-mode plan` (read-only), and
  `opencode` runs `--pure` (no external plugins) and is never given `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
  Full OS isolation (containers/seccomp) is still out of scope; the strongest mitigation — use a
  local backend (`ollama`) for sensitive subtitles — is documented in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Token-aware block sizing and map-reduce analysis.** Blocks are sized by line count. Subtitle
  lines are inherently short (it's a subtitle), so a fixed line budget rarely strains a model's
  context; a token-budget scheduler and hierarchical analysis for very long inputs are not
  warranted (the `analyze` cap with a notice covers the rare overflow).
- **Multi-writer coordination for memory.** The memory store assumes a single writer (one project
  processed at a time). There is no file locking or concurrent-update merging; atomic writes
  prevent *corruption*, not two processes racing on the same project.
- **Persistent TOML config, structured/JSON logging, and a web UI.** Configuration is via flags;
  output is human-readable text.

### Known limitations (accepted trade-offs)

- **`opencode` receives the prompt as a process argument** (visible in process listings, bounded
  by `ARG_MAX`). Translation blocks are small (a few KB), so this is accepted; the other CLI
  backends use stdin.
- **`flatten_overlaps` is O(n²)** in the number of cues and does not cap stacking — negligible
  for normal subtitle sizes (~1–2k cues), but a moment where many cues overlap will produce a
  single cue with that many stacked lines. Only relevant to `--format srt`; the default `.ass`
  keeps cues positioned and is unaffected.
- **`analyze` caps the transcript** (currently 4000 lines) to bound prompt size; longer inputs
  are truncated and the command prints a notice saying how many trailing lines were dropped.
- **`review --apply` only writes fixes when the target maps 1:1 to the source.** That holds for
  the default `.ass` output. On a `.srt` whose overlapping cues were merged (counts differ),
  `--apply` is **automatically skipped with a notice** — the report is still written for reading —
  so a fix is never applied to the wrong cue. Re-run review against the `.ass` to apply fixes.
  Applied review fixes and readability compactions preserve whole-line leading ASS override tags
  such as positioning, alignment and colour.
- **`file-handoff` does not hash or version jobs.** It is a manual escape hatch; make sure you
  fill the matching `*.out.json`.

### Planned, not yet implemented

- Audio-assisted gender and a simple web UI.
